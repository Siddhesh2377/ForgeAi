# Inspect (02)

Inspect provides deep analysis of a loaded model — 3D architecture visualization, memory breakdown, capability detection, quantization distribution, runtime compatibility, and more.

<Note>
  A model must be loaded via the Load module before Inspect is available.

## Isometric 3D Visualization

An interactive isometric view renders the model as stacked blocks:

- **Embedding layer** at the bottom
- **Transformer layers** stacked vertically, colored by attention/MLP tensor ratio
- **Output layer** at the top

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Hover | Tooltip with tensor breakdown |
| `+` / `-` buttons | Zoom in / out |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom |
| Reset button | Reset view |

## Memory Distribution

Six-component breakdown showing how memory is allocated:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Embeddings | Token embedding weights |
| Attention | Q, K, V, O projection matrices |
| MLP | Gate, up, down projection matrices |
| Norms | RMSNorm / LayerNorm weights |
| Output | LM head / output projection |
| Other | Miscellaneous tensors |

Each component shows exact byte count, percentage, and a proportional bar.

## Quantization Breakdown

For each dtype present (F32, F16, BF16, Q8\_0, Q4\_K\_M, etc.):
- Tensor count, total size, percentage, and visual bar chart

## Capability Detection

<img src="/images/light/inspect-caps-light.png" alt="Inspect Capabilities" />

Analyzes model architecture to detect 7 capabilities with confidence scores:

| Capability | What It Detects |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Tool Calling** | API/function calling ability |
| **Reasoning** | Chain-of-thought reasoning |
| **Code** | Code generation/understanding |
| **Mathematics** | Mathematical reasoning |
| **Multilingual** | Multi-language support |
| **Instruction** | Instruction following |
| **Safety** | Safety/alignment layers |

## Runtime Compatibility Matrix

Checks support across 8 popular inference runtimes:

| Runtime | Formats |
|---------|---------|
| llama.cpp | GGUF |
| Ollama | GGUF |
| LM Studio | GGUF |
| KoboldCpp | GGUF |
| GPT4All | GGUF |
| Jan | GGUF |
| LocalAI | GGUF |
| text-generation-webui | GGUF, SafeTensors |

Status: COMPATIBLE, PARTIAL, or NOT SUPPORTED.
