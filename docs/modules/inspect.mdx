# Inspect (02)

Inspect provides deep analysis of a loaded model — memory breakdown, quantization distribution, runtime compatibility, and an isometric 3D visualization.

<Note>
  A model must be loaded via the Load module before Inspect is available.
</Note>

## Isometric Visualization

An interactive 3D isometric view renders the model as stacked blocks:

- **Embedding layer** at the bottom
- **Transformer layers** stacked vertically, colored by attention/MLP tensor ratio
- **Output layer** at the top

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Hover | Tooltip with tensor breakdown |
| `+` / `-` buttons | Zoom in / out |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom |
| Reset button | Reset view |

## Memory Distribution

Horizontal bar chart showing memory by component:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Embeddings | Token embedding weights |
| Attention | Q, K, V, O projection matrices |
| MLP | Gate, up, down projection matrices |
| Norms | Layer normalization weights |
| Output | LM head / output projection |

Each component shows bytes, percentage, and a proportional bar.

## Quantization Breakdown

For each dtype present (F32, F16, BF16, Q8\_0, Q4\_K\_M, etc.):
- Tensor count, total size, percentage, and visual bar

## Attention Architecture

- Query heads and KV heads count
- Head dimension and GQA ratio
- Visual head diagram

## Tokenizer Info

- Tokenizer type (BPE, Unigram, WordPiece)
- Vocabulary size
- Special tokens (BOS, EOS, PAD, UNK) with IDs

## Runtime Compatibility

| Runtime | Formats |
|---------|---------|
| llama.cpp | GGUF |
| Ollama | GGUF |
| LM Studio | GGUF |
| KoboldCpp | GGUF |
| vLLM | SafeTensors |
| HF Transformers | SafeTensors |
| ExLlamaV2 | SafeTensors |
| MLX | SafeTensors |

Status: COMPATIBLE, PARTIAL, or NOT SUPPORTED.

## File Verification

Click **COMPUTE HASH** to calculate SHA-256 fingerprint for integrity verification.

## Data Export

- **JSON** — Full model metadata
- **CSV** — Tensor list with names, dtypes, shapes

## Layer Hierarchy

Expandable list per layer showing attention, MLP, norm, and other tensors. Filter by name, dtype, or layer range.
