# M-DNA Forge (08)

M-DNA Forge is ForgeAI's model merging system. Load multiple parent models, choose a merge strategy, configure layer assignments, and build a hybrid offspring.

## Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Parent** | A source model contributing weights (2–5 supported) |
| **Offspring** | The resulting merged model |
| **Base model** | A reference model required by some methods (TIES, DARE, Task Arithmetic) |
| **Layer assignment** | Which parent provides which layer in the offspring (Frankenmerge/Passthrough) |

## Merge Methods

| Method | Min Parents | Requires Base | Difficulty | Description |
|--------|:----------:|:-------------:|:----------:|-------------|
| SLERP | 2 | No | Easy | Spherical interpolation between two models |
| Average | 2 | No | Easy | Weighted mean of all tensors |
| Passthrough | 2 | No | Easy | Stack layers from parents sequentially |
| Frankenmerge | 2 | No | Intermediate | Pick specific layers from specific parents |
| Task Arithmetic | 2 | Yes | Intermediate | Add task vectors for multi-task models |
| TIES | 2 | Yes | Advanced | Trim, elect sign, merge — resolves interference |
| DARE | 2 | Yes | Advanced | Drop and rescale delta parameters |
| DeLLa | 2 | Yes | Advanced | Density-based layer-level adaptive merging |

## Difficulty Modes

| Mode | Available Methods |
|------|------------------|
| Easy | SLERP, Average, Passthrough |
| Intermediate | + Frankenmerge, Task Arithmetic |
| Advanced | All methods |

## Layout

Two-column layout:

- **Left**: Isometric 3D visualization — parent towers + offspring tower, color-coded by parent assignment
- **Right**: Tabbed panel with three tabs

### Files Tab

- Parent model cards with name, params, layers, format, size
- **+ LOAD FILE** / **+ LOAD FOLDER** to add parents
- **SET BASE** button (for methods requiring a base)
- Compatibility report and composition bar

### Layers Tab

- **AUTO: SPLIT** — Alternating parent assignment (A, B, A, B...)
- **AUTO: INTERLEAVE** — Equal chunk assignment
- Per-layer list: click to cycle assigned parent
- **COMPUTE LAYERS** for specialization analysis (Syntactic/Semantic/Reasoning badges)

### Settings Tab

- Mode selector (Easy / Intermediate / Advanced)
- Method grid filtered by mode
- Method-specific parameter sliders (t, scaling, density, trim)
- Output: format (SafeTensors/GGUF), model name, output path

## Compatibility Checking

With 2+ parents loaded, ForgeAI checks:
- Architecture match
- Hidden dimension match
- Layer count match
- Shared tensor count

## Output Formats

| Format | Output |
|--------|--------|
| **SafeTensors** | Directory with `model.safetensors` + tokenizer/config files |
| **GGUF** | Single `.gguf` file with embedded metadata and tokenizer |

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Load parents">
    Add 2+ models via the Files tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check compatibility">
    Review the compatibility report
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Select mode, method, and tune parameters in the Settings tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign layers">
    For Frankenmerge: set layer assignments in the Layers tab (or use AUTO)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build">
    Click **BUILD MERGE**, monitor progress, view result
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Best practices:**
  - 2 similar models → **SLERP** with t=0.5
  - Base + finetune → **TIES** or **DARE**
  - Cherry-pick layers → **Frankenmerge** with manual assignments
  - Avoid **AVERAGE** on dissimilar models (produces incoherent output)
</Tip>
