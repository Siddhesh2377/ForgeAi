# Dashboard (00)

The Dashboard is the first screen when ForgeAI launches. It shows current system status, loaded model info, and provides quick access to every module with real-time activity tracking.

## System Status Banner

Displays the ForgeAI brand and a live specs grid:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| STATUS | Current state — IDLE, LOADED, TRAINING, MERGING, ANALYZING, COMPLETE, ERROR |
| MODEL | Name of loaded model or "---" |
| FORMAT | GGUF or SAFETENSORS |
| PARAMS | Parameter count (e.g., 7.24B) |
| SIZE | File size on disk |
| QUANT | Quantization type (e.g., Q4\_K\_M) |

## Module Groups

Modules are organized into three groups matching the sidebar:

| Group | Modules |
|-------|---------|
| **MODEL** | Load (01), Inspect (02), Compress (03) |
| **DATA** | Hub (04), DataStudio (10), Training (06) |
| **TOOLS** | Convert (05), M-DNA (08), Test (09) |

Each module card shows:
- Module code and name
- Short description
- Supported formats/operations
- Current status badge (ready / awaiting / active)

## Live Activity Badges

When background tasks are running, module cards show real-time activity:

| Activity | Badge Example |
|----------|-------------|
| Training in progress | `TRAINING 45%` (blue, pulsing) |
| Layer surgery | `SURGERY` (blue, pulsing) |
| Model merging | `MERGING 72%` (blue, pulsing) |
| Layer analysis | `ANALYZING` (blue, pulsing) |
| Merge complete | `COMPLETE` (green) |
| Dataset loaded | `52,002 ROWS` (green) |
| Model loading | `LOADING` (blue, pulsing) |

Click any module card to navigate directly to it.

## Status Bar

Persistent across all screens at the bottom of the app:
- Left: current state indicator, loaded model name, format, parameters
- Right: CPU cores/threads, memory usage, version info
- Status bar border color changes: blue during active tasks, green on success, red on error

## Sidebar Progress

When a long-running task is active (training, merging, analyzing), the sidebar shows a progress indicator with percentage and pulsing animation.
