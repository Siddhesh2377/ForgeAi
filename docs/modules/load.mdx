# Load (01)

The Load module imports AI models into ForgeAI. It parses model headers without reading the full file, extracting metadata, tensor maps, and architecture information.

## Load Options

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="GGUF File" icon="file">
    Single `.gguf` file — quantized models from the llama.cpp ecosystem
  </Card>
  <Card title="SafeTensors File" icon="file">
    Single `.safetensors` file — HuggingFace model weights
  </Card>
  <Card title="Model Folder" icon="folder">
    Directory with `.safetensors` + `config.json` — sharded HuggingFace models
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What Gets Parsed

On load, ForgeAI reads the model header and extracts:

- **Architecture** (e.g., LlamaForCausalLM, MistralForCausalLM)
- **Layer count** and context length
- **Embedding dimensions**
- **Parameter count** (computed from tensor shapes)
- **Quantization type** (GGUF only)
- **Tensor map** — names, dtypes, and shapes of all tensors
- **Raw metadata** — all key-value pairs from the model header

For folder-based models, it additionally detects:
- Number of shards
- Presence of `config.json`
- Presence of tokenizer files

## Hero Panel

| Field | Values |
|-------|--------|
| STATUS | IDLE, LOADING, LOADED, ERROR |
| FORMAT | GGUF or SAFETENSORS |
| SIZE | File size on disk |
| PARAMS | Parameter count |
| TENSORS | Total tensor count |
| QUANT | Quantization type |

## Metadata Grid

After loading, a grid displays architecture, layers, context length, embedding dimension, quantization, tensors, parameters, and file size.

## Tensor Map Preview

A table showing tensor names, dtypes, and shapes. For large models the preview is capped with a count of remaining tensors.

## Raw Metadata

A scrollable list of the first 20 metadata key-value pairs from the model header.

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click a load button">
    Choose **LOAD GGUF FILE**, **LOAD SAFETENSORS FILE**, or **LOAD MODEL FOLDER**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select file or folder">
    Pick your model in the system dialog
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review metadata">
    Header parsing takes under 1 second. Review model metadata, tensor map, and raw metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the model">
    The model is now available in Inspect, Optimize, Test, and other modules. Click **UNLOAD** to clear it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
